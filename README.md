### Installation
 To clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/lindenconrad/TEAM-5-ADS506-Final-Project.git
   ```

### Project Summary
This project analyzes three major U.S. retail sales categories using monthly time-series data from the U.S. Census Bureau/FRED (1992–2019):
Clothing Stores, Furniture & Home Furnishings, and Electronic Shopping & Mail-Order (E-Commerce).
Our goal was to uncover long-term trends and seasonal patterns, then compare forecasting approaches to determine which model best fits each retail category.

Results show that no single model performs best across all categories. Instead, each retail sector displays unique behavior requiring a category-specific forecasting strategy.

#### Project Objectives
1. Explore and visualize long-term retail sales behavior.
2. Determine whether series exhibit trend, seasonality, or structural changes.
3. Fit and compare forecasting models to identify the best model per category.
